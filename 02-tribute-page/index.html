            <div id="tribute-info">
                <p>Sir Frederick Banting, born in Ontario, Canada in 1891, is an idol both in the realm of
                    science and in the diabetic community. He was the man who discovered insulin, the life-saving drug
                    that turned type 1 diabetes from a death sentence into a manageable disease, prolonging the lives of
                    millions of diabetics since the year 1920, when the discovery was made.
                </p>

                <p>Banting's journey started out as a student at the University of Toronto. His drive to find a cure for
                    type 1 diabetes came from a childhood friend of his who, at 14 years old, died from type 1 diabetes.
                    The symptoms of type 1 diabetes were brutal and life-threatening at the time. The most common
                    symptoms were an unquenchable thirst and severe weight loss, which among other symptoms, eventually
                    killed its patients months after diagnosis. Banting thought "How did no one find a cure for this
                    disease yet?". This lit a fire in him that nobody could put out. Although he was not the best
                    student, Banting was determined to find the cure. In 1920, after extensive research, he found that
                    the islet cells of Langerhans in the pancreas were the main contributing factor to diabetes, or, in
                    more detailed terms, their secretion (otherwise known as insulin).</p>

                <p>Since that discovery, Banting spent years with the help of other distinguished individuals
                    today such as Best, Collip and Macleod conducting clinical trials on dogs and later on, humans
                    until 1922, when the first successful trial of insulin on humans was recorded. This life-saving
                    discovery was what made Banting the youngest recipient of a Nobel Prize in Medicine.
                </p>

                <p>Fast forward to today, diabetics and others alike celebrate Banting for the number of lives he has
                    saved with his discovery. Although Banting had sold the patent to insulin for 1 dollar with the
                    hopes of making it more accessible to people worldwide, some countries such as the United States
                    continue to extort diabetic patients by selling single vials of insulin that cost a few dollars to
                    manufacture for hundreds of dollars, putting several patients in medical debt and forcing them to
                    ration insulin, which eventually lead to death. However, that is a story for another time...</p>
